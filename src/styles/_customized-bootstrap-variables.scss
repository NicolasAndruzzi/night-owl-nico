// The SASS version of Bootstrap has all the default colours, font sizes,
// backgrounds etc. defined in a separate file

// This allows you to customise it and have your own version of Bootstrap.
// (You might want to change the primary colour for buttons across the whole
// framework, or the default radius for buttons.)

// If you are curious what variables you can override, then have a look at the
// original _variables.scss file at:
// "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss"
